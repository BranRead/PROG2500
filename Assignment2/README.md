# Face Changer
## Description 
### This is a small application in which the user can select facial features for the face on the screen
### The back arrow moves backwards through the list and the forward arrow moves forward. 
### All these arrows alter the feature which it is labelled for.
### You can also click randomize to get a random combo of facial features. 
## Technical
### I use string arrays of the paths to the images. These arrays are moved through using the arrows and then the panel which holds the corresponding image is changed.
### The randomize button picks a random index for each array and then the corresponding image is changed for each. 
### The current index is also changed so that the facial features remain in the same order while pressing the buttons.
### I got the images for the faces here: https://elvgames.itch.io/free-facesets-pixelart 
### I altered the nose to make different nose options and I altered the images to give seperate png's of each part I needed!
