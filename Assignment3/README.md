# Face Changer
## Description 
### This is the second iteration on the face changer assignment completed for assignment 2
### There is a radio button for skin tone, dropdowns for facial features, checkboxes for which features to change when randomizing and a slider to randomize 
## Technical
### I use string arrays of the paths to the images.
### The randomize button picks a random index for each array and then the corresponding image is changed for each.
### The radio buttons select which skin tone is used. 
### This would be an excellant use case for the slider or a color picker.
### The checkboxes allow a specific feature to be changed with the randomize slider
### The slider is just a fun way to choose a random face and was a requirement of the assignment.
### Each time a dropdown option is selected the index of the dropdown is used to find the path for that correspondingimage within its array.  
### I got the images for the faces here: https://elvgames.itch.io/free-facesets-pixelart 
### I altered the nose to make different nose options and I altered the images to give seperate png's of each part I needed!
