# Face Changer
## Description 
### This is the third iteration on the face changer assignment completed for assignment 2
### Checkboxes for features to randomize and buttons to change individual features. All mapped to keys. F1 and F2 for backwards and forwards for hair, F3 and F4 for backwards and forwards for eyes, and so on.  
## Technical
### Each png is labeled the same: "<bodyPart><number>" So this time I don't have any arrays. I have one int tracking that <number> and functions get passed a string value which caN be used for <bodyPart>
### The randomize button picks a random feature for each selected. In the range of 1 - <number of pictures>
### Skin tone choices are in the File menu. 
### The user can also quit through here and with Ctrl+Q.
### I got the images for the faces here: https://elvgames.itch.io/free-facesets-pixelart 
### I altered the nose to make different nose options and I altered the images to give seperate png's of each part I needed!
